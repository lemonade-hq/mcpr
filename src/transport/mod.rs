//! Transport layer for MCP communication
//!
//! This module provides transport implementations for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
//! Transports handle the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received.
//!
//! The following transport types are supported:
//! - Stdio: Standard input/output for local processes
//! - SSE: Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages with HTTP POST for client-to-server
//! - WebSocket: Bidirectional communication over WebSockets
//!
//! The transport implementations are now fully async, using tokio for async I/O.
